$PNAME is used after checking out a clean repository, to make sure that
all the required directories are present. sts/assess and sts/makefile
do not have the ability to create missing directories, and git doesn't
record empty directories. I'd like to keep the NIST distribution pristene
(at least for now), so you need to run this script after a clean checkout,
before doing your first build. It won't hurt to re-run it.

For testing, $PNAME --clean will remove all the subdirectories that this
script creates.
